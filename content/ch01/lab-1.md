# Lab 1: Switchyard & Mininet

## Overview

In this chapter we will introduce all preparations for our network experiments. Then your are going to modify the examples we provide according to our requirements.

## Details

Our lab assignments are based on CS640 in University of Wisconsin. Most materials are the same. In the future, we will improve the experiment based on your feedback.

In this lab assignment, you will gradually master our experimental environment. But some preliminary abilities are required in our experiments such as how to program and debug in Linux. If you are not familiar with these, feel free to contact TAs. We will provide you with some helpful information to get started quickly.

### Platform

The platform of our labs is Switchyard. You can implement a device with various functions in Switchyard by writing Python codes. Then you can run your device in Mininet and capture packets using Wireshark. You will use Git to manage your projects and submit them. All these software are installed on Linux. We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your editor.

Here is the list of softwares we mentioned (sorted by learning order).

- Linux
- Python
- Git
- Mininet
- Wireshark
- Switchyard
- VS Code

## Your Tasks

> [!NOTE]
> The sentences marked with ✅ are related to the content of your report. Please pay attention.

### Task 1: Get Ready

Meet the requirements for using Linux, Python and Git. We assume that you have a basic understanding of these contents.

## Handing it in

### Report

We will provide a template of your lab assignment report [here](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/123a70ac8ff34595b18f/). You need to submit the report in your repository named `<学号><姓名>_lab_1`. The format of your report can be Microsoft Doc or PDF. An example is `123456789拾佰仟_lab_1.pdf`.

### Capture file

The capture file's name should be `lab_1.pcapng` or `lab_1.pcap`. If you capture packets using *superuser*, you may meet some problems. Read the tips below.

> [!WARNING]
> You may (or as I expect you must) meet the error when you try to modify/delete the files generated by Wireshark or Switchyard programs running on hosts in Mininet. It is because the owner of these files is superuser `root`. You need to change the owner to your login user. Run the command below on your capture file. Replace `<file>` to the file path of your capture file.
> ```
> $ sudo chown $USER:$USER <file>
> ```
> Another useful command `ls -l` can check if the owner of the file is `root`. You can see the file belonging to `root` is `test.log` in the example.
> ```
> (syenv) cyq@cyq-VirtualBox:~/switchyard$ ls -l
> total 88

> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   181 2月  21 21:42 lab_1.pcap
> drwxrwxr-x 2 cyq  cyq   4096 2月  20 17:33 tests
> ```
> In this case, running the command `sudo chown $USER:$USER ./lab_1.pcap` can change the owner to my user `cyq`.
> As we mentioned before, be careful when using `sudo` since it may have potential risks.

### Submit to NJU GitLab

When you are ready to submit, do the following.

1. Modify your code according to Task 3, complete your report and save your capture file.

2. When you have done your work, put your report, code and capture file in the folder `lab_1` and commit them. Tag the commit named `<学号/lab_1>` which you want to submit. An example is `123456789/lab_1`. For more about tag, read [Git 基础 - 打标签](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2/Git-%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80-%E6%89%93%E6%A0%87%E7%AD%BE). Finally your project will look like

   ```
   switchyard/
     ├─docs/
     ├─.../
   m ├─lab_1/
   + │ ├─123456789拾佰仟_lab_1.pdf
   m │ ├─hubtests.py
   + │ ├─lab_1.pcapng
   m │ ├─myhub.py
   m │ └─start_mininet.py
     ├─.gitignore
     └─...
   ```

   > [!WARNING]
   > The file names in your submission have to **exactly** match the file names above. Otherwise, you will lose points!

3. Submit your work by pushing your local repository to your remote repository **with your tags** by running the command `git push origin --tags`.

   > [!WARNING]
   > **Only** commit your **source code** to your local repository. If there are some generated files that are not source code, ignore them by adding them in the file `.gitignore`.
