# Task 1: Prerequisites

There are three things you need to know. The operating system we use is Linux. The program language we use is Python. And the distributed version control system we use is Git. We list some helpful materials below.

- [Linux](linux.md)
- [Python](python.md)
- [Git](git.md)

In further experiments, we assume that you **have mastered** the use of these tools.
